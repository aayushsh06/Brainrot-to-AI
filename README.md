2. Import all neccessary APIs and libraries |.req file coming soon
3. In order to use auto story generation, a GROQ API KEY must be included(can be obtained for free)

5. Before generating videos on personal device, you must download a .mp4 video for your background and input the filename in combine.py (To download a YT video, personalDownload.py can be used)
