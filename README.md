# Text-to-AI
### What is it?
The "Text-to-AI" app automates the creation of viral-style videos inspired by "brainrot" content on platforms like YouTube and TikTok. These videos feature AI-generated voiceovers reading scripts (e.g., Reddit stories) with synchronized captions and randomly selected background visuals. 

### Steps to use: 
1. Download all files 
2. Install all neccessary APIs and libraries using `requirements.txt`
3. In order to use auto story/brainrot generation, a `GROQ API KEY` must be included (can be obtained for free)
4. In order to use to reddit story generation, a `PRAW key` must be obtained and setup by filling in the associated fields in `reddit.py`
5. Before generating videos, you must download a `.mp4` video for your background and input the filename in `combine.py` (To download a YT video, `personalDownload.py` can be used by inserting the YT vid link and running `python3 personalDownload.py`)


- All code was run on a `Python 3.10.15` virtual environment
